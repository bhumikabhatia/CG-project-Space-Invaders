# Computer Graphics Project: 2K18/CO/110
<h2>Space Invaders</h2>
In this project, the main aim is to build a version of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders, by the use of Pygame. Pygame is a python module that is used for video games. Space Invaders is a game which has rows of aliens, which slowly move across and down the screen, and the player, has to shoot bullets and kill the aliens while it is being attacked by the alien enemy's bullets. We make our own version of that game, which includes different points for different aliens, a special ship for bonus points, dual lasers and also introduce an interesting background. As the game proceeds, the difficulty of the game increases.
